# caymanflow: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [Quality Control](#quality-control) - Read QC and trimming (optional)
- [Cayman](#cayman) - Direct annotation of metagenomic reads
- [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

## Quality Control

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `qc/fastp/`
  - `*.json`: FastQC report in JSON format
  - `*.html`: FastQC report in HTML format for easy viewing

</details>

[fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) is used for quality control and adapter trimming of the input reads. It provides:

- Quality filtering
- Adapter trimming
- Quality score statistics
- Base content analysis

This step can be skipped by providing the `--skip_qc` flag.

## Cayman

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `cayman/`
  - `*.csv`: Cayman annotation results for each sample

</details>

[Cayman](https://github.com/zellerlab/cayman) directly annotates carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) from metagenomic reads without requiring assembly or gene prediction. 

The output CSV files contain:
- Identified CAZyme families
- Abundance information
- Functional classifications

Cayman uses the CAZy database to classify enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of complex carbohydrates.

## Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
